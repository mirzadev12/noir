/**
 * Freeze three real cases for demo mode. AGENTS.md §10.
 *
 * Run this with the dev server up:
 *
 *     node scripts/freeze-cases.mjs
 *
 * It finds real TRON addresses that should resolve to each disposition, runs
 * them through **our own live pipeline** (`POST /api/trace`, the same endpoint
 * the interface uses), and writes whatever came back into
 * `data/demo-cases.json`. Nothing is invented: each stored case is a complete
 * TraceResult with the SHA-256 of every chain response it was built from, so
 * any claim in it can be checked afterwards.
 *
 * Finding the candidates is the same trick the whole project rests on, run
 * backwards. We already hold 165 addresses that sweep into exchange hot wallets
 * and 334 addresses from the OFAC list; anyone who *sent* to one of those has,
 * by construction, a trail that ends there. So:
 *
 *   WARM — someone who paid into a known customer deposit address
 *   COLD — someone who paid into a sanctioned address
 *   HOT  — someone whose money is sitting at an address with no way out
 *
 * The disposition is never assumed. Each candidate is traced and the result is
 * only kept if the pipeline independently reached the disposition we wanted.
