/**
 * Does an Ethereum deposit-address attribution still hold when it is read again?
 *
 *   node scripts/calibrate-clustering-eth.mjs
 *
 * The Ethereum counterpart of `calibrate-clustering.mjs`, and the same
 * question: every row in `data/eth/deposit-addresses.json` carries a
 * confidence from `0.5 + sweeps × 0.03`, and a confidence figure is only worth
 * printing if it has been checked. So every row — the whole set, not a sample:
 * Blockscout answers 180 requests a minute without a key, which reads the
 * whole set (221 on 25 Sep) in about ten minutes — is re-read and re-tested
 * with the rule that found it:
 *
 *  - **sweep route** (found among the senders into a tagged exchange wallet):
 *    still forwards at least 90% of its USDT to that exchange's tagged wallets,
 *    in at least two sweeps;
 *  - **funder route** (gas-funded by the exchange's tagged deposit funder):
 *    still forwards at least 90% of its USDT to the wallet it was found
 *    sweeping to, at least once. The gas funding is a past transaction and
 *    cannot change; the sweep is what can stop;
 *  - **both**: holds if either does.
 *
 * Same limits as the TRON measurement, stated where the result is shown: this
 * tests whether the pattern *persists* on transfers the derivation never saw,
 * not who owns the address — only the exchange can confirm that — and an
 * address the chain would not answer for is excluded from every rate, never
 * counted as a failure. Transfers under 1 USDT never count, exactly as in the
 * derivation (address-poisoning dust). Persistence also means little when the
 * re-read comes soon after the derivation: the rows that swept again since are
 * the ones actually tested, and the output counts them.
 *
 * **A second, independent test: who paid the gas.** An Ethereum deposit
 * address cannot move its USDT without ETH for gas, and exchanges send that ETH
 * from their own wallets. For every row found by the sweep rule alone, the
 * senders of ETH into the address are read with the explorer's tags on them:
 *
 *  - **agrees** — a sender is tagged as the same exchange: a second behaviour,
 *    independent of the sweeps, points at the same exchange (a wallet that
 *    merely settles to an exchange sends it money, but does not get its gas
 *    from it);
 *  - **conflicts** — no sender is, but one is tagged as another entity's gas,
 *    fee, funder or custody wallet: someone else manages this address, which is
 *    the method's known failure (a custodied or merchant wallet that settles to
 *    one exchange looks like a customer deposit address);
 *  - **no signal** — no tagged sender either way (a customer withdrawing ETH
 *    from another exchange's hot wallet is neither).
 *
 * Rows found through the exchange's gas wallet are left out of this test: they
 * were found by it, so it cannot confirm them.
