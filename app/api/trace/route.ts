/**
 * POST /api/trace — run a live trace. AGENTS.md §5.
 *
 * Body: { address, amount?, fraudDate?, model?, asOf? }
 *
 * `model: "fifo"` traces under first-in-first-out instead of the proportional
 * haircut, exactly as `?model=fifo` does on the permalink.
 *
 * `asOf` reads the chain as it stood at that moment. It exists so a recorded
 * case can be re-derived after a rule changes (`scripts/rescore-cases.mjs`);
 * an investigator never needs it, and the interface never sends it.
 *
 * This reads the chain on every call, so it is deliberately dynamic and never
 * cached: a trace answers "where is the money now", and a cached answer to that
 * question is worse than no answer.
