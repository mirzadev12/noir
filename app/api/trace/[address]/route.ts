 * GET /api/trace/[address] — the shareable permalink for a trace. AGENTS.md §5.
 *
 * A bare permalink re-runs the trace over the wallet's full visible history and
 * adopts everything that left the address as the amount, so it answers "what
 * does this wallet look like now". A link made inside the app also carries
 * `?amount=` and `?since=` — the run it came from — so it replays that run
 * exactly, and `?asof=` pins it to the moment that run was read, so it shows
 * the same case on any later day. `?model=fifo` traces under
 * first-in-first-out instead of haircut.
