/**
 * GET /api/wallet/[address] — what a single wallet is, and who funded it.
 *
 * A fourth endpoint, where AGENTS.md §5 specifies three. On the record as a
 * deliberate deviation: the three it names all answer "where did the money go",
 * and none of them answers "what is this address". An investigator looking at a
 * node on the graph asks the second question immediately, and until now the
 * only way to answer it was to leave for a block explorer.
 *
 * It reads the same chain client, the same attribution table and the same
 * provenance discipline as the tracer, so nothing new is claimed here — it is
 * the existing pipeline pointed backwards at one wallet.
