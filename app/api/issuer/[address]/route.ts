/**
 * GET /api/issuer/[address] — has Tether, the issuer of USDT, frozen this
 * address? Read from the USDT contract's own blacklist, on TRON or Ethereum.
 *
 * Built for money at rest in a private wallet, where no exchange can be asked
 * to act and the issuer is the one party that still can. `status` is `frozen`,
 * `not-frozen`, or `unchecked` when the chain did not answer — never a guess.
 * The answer is the chain as it stands now, stamped with `checkedAt` and the
 * SHA-256 of the response it was read from. Reads one value; writes nothing.
