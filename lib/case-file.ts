/**
 * The shared case file — the rules, kept free of files (`tests/case-file.test.mjs`).
 *
 * The committed register (`public/mock/cases.json`) is the same for everyone
 * and never changes. This is the other half: runs officers traced on this
 * server and chose to keep, visible to every officer who opens the same
 * server's Case queue.
 *
 * **A saved case is made from the server's own record, never from what a
 * browser sends.** The browser names a run — its address and its findings
 * fingerprint — and the server looks for the trace it recorded with that
 * fingerprint in its audit log (`lib/audit-store.ts`). Only a run this server
 * actually traced can be saved, and the disposition, exit and amounts shown for
 * it are the ones the server computed. Opening a saved case replays that exact
 * run: the same amount and window, the chain as it stood when it was read.
 *
 * This is also what `GET /api/cases` in AGENTS.md §5 always asked for — a
 * `CaseSummary[]` — and it stayed unbuilt until there was a record honest
 * enough to serve through it.
