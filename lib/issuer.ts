/**
 * Has the issuer frozen this address? The one freeze that does not depend on
 * an exchange.
 *
 * Tether's USDT contract keeps a blacklist on both chains NOIR traces, and a
 * blacklisted address cannot move its USDT at all — whatever wallet software
 * holds it, wherever it sits. So for money found at rest in a private wallet,
 * where there is no exchange to write to, the issuer is the one party that can
 * still stop it, and whether it already has is the first thing an officer
 * needs to know.
 *
 * The answer is read from the contract itself, never inferred:
 *
 *   isBlackListed(address) → bool      selector 0xe47d6060
 *
 * Verified on 25 Sep 2026 against addresses the contract's own AddedBlackList
 * events had just named: true for each of them on Ethereum (block 26,049,478)
 * and on TRON, false for Binance 14 and Binance-Hot 7.
 *
 * Three answers, never two, by the rule the watch follows: frozen, not frozen,
 * or not checked. A node that did not answer is "unchecked", never "not frozen".
 * The answer is the chain as it stands now — not as of any recorded moment —
 * and it carries the time it was read and the SHA-256 of the response.
