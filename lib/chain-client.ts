/**
 * What the tracer needs from a chain, and nothing more.

 *
 *  - `transfers` is USDT only, newest first, capped, cached per trace.
 *  - A wallet the chain did not answer for is `didFail`, never an empty list.
 *  - A wallet read only in part is `wasTruncated`, never a whole one.
 *  - Every response body is SHA-256 hashed and every request counted.
