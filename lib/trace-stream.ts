/**
 * Streams a trace to the browser as newline-delimited JSON.
 *
 * A live trace reads the chain wallet by wallet and can take the better part of
 * a minute. Returned as one JSON body, the screen has nothing to show for that
 * minute but a spinner — and a fetch timeout shorter than the slowest trace
 * silently turns a working trace into "no data". Streamed, every wallet read,
 * hop and attribution reaches the screen the moment the tracer does it, and the
 * client only gives up if the stream goes quiet, not because a trace is long.
 *
 * Lines:
 *   {"kind":"progress","event":{…},"at":1234}
 *   {"kind":"result","trace":{…},"provenance":"live"}
 *   {"kind":"error","message":"…"}
 *
 * Plain JSON callers are unaffected: a route only streams when the request asks
 * for `application/x-ndjson` (or `?stream=1`).
