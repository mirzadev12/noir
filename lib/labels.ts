/**
 * Attribution lookup. AGENTS.md §9.
 *
 * One Map built once at module load from the three data files. Every screen and
 * every route asks this and nothing else, so there is exactly one place that
 * decides what an address is.
 *
 * Two rules matter more than the code:
 *
 *  1. **Priority.** An address can appear in more than one list, and the answer
 *     must be deterministic:
 *
 *         sanctioned > exchange hot wallet > exchange deposit address > community
 *
 *     A sanctioned address that also happens to be an exchange wallet is
 *     reported as sanctioned. Understating a sanctions hit is the worse error.
 *
 *  2. **Source honesty.** An explorer tag is `ground_truth`. A sweep-pattern
 *     match is `heuristic`. An OFAC listing is `sanctions`. The interface shows
 *     this tier, and showing our uncertainty is the point — a label that claims
 *     more than it can support is worse than no label.
