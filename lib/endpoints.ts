/**
 * Where the chain is read from — and so who learns which wallets are being
 * investigated.
 *
 * Every read NOIR makes names a wallet an officer is looking at. Against the
 * public endpoints that is a record, held by a third party, of which addresses
 * are under investigation and when. A deployment can instead point each kind
 * of read at infrastructure it runs itself, one setting each:
 *
 *   TRONGRID_URL    TRON wallet histories and transaction lookups: an API
 *                   serving TronGrid's /v1/accounts/{a}/transactions/trc20 and
 *                   /v1/transactions/{id}/events
 *   TRON_NODE_URL   the Tether freeze check on TRON: a full node's HTTP API
 *                   (/wallet/triggerconstantcontract), as java-tron serves it
 *   BLOCKSCOUT_URL  every Ethereum history read: a Blockscout instance's API v2
 *                   base (ending /api/v2); Blockscout is open source
 *   ETH_RPC_URL     the Tether freeze check on Ethereum: any JSON-RPC node
 *   POLYGON_BLOCKSCOUT_URL, POLYGON_RPC_URL   the same two, for Polygon PoS
 *
 * Three rules, all for the same reason — a silent fallback would send the very
 * wallet a setting exists to keep in-house:
 *
 *  - **A setting that is given is used alone.** When the agency's node is down,
 *    those reads fail and say so; they never go to a public endpoint instead.
 *    A setting that is not an http(s) URL fails the same way.
 *  - **A chain read in-house stays in-house.** With TRONGRID_URL set, the TRON
 *    freeze check uses TRON_NODE_URL or, failing that, the same host (TronGrid
 *    serves both APIs); with BLOCKSCOUT_URL set, the Ethereum freeze check uses
 *    ETH_RPC_URL or is not made.
 *  - **A key goes only to the service it belongs to.** TRONGRID_API_KEY and
 *    BLOCKSCOUT_API_KEY are never sent to an agency's own endpoint.
 *
 * `/api/health` says, for each kind of read, "own", "public", "invalid" or
 * "none" (not made) — never the address itself.
 *
 * Server-only.
