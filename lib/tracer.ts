/**
 * Forward trace from a victim-reported address. AGENTS.md §9.
 *
 * Five limits, and every one of them exists because without it the trace
 * explodes and the demo dies:
 *
 *   depth <= 3
 *   the five largest outflows per wallet, by value
 *   drop any transfer below 1% of the reported amount
 *   only transfers after the fraud date
 *   stop expanding the moment a wallet is attributable — that is the answer
 *
 * And one rule that is not a limit but causality: a wallet the money reached is
 * followed only through what it sent *after* the money arrived. A transfer made
 * before the victim's money got there cannot contain any of it.
 *
 * Taint is what makes this evidence rather than a picture. A wallet that
 * received 40% of its parent's outgoing value inherits 40% of the parent's
 * taint, so the result can say "46,208 USDT of the victim's money reached this
 * address" instead of "this address exists".

/**
 * How stolen money is followed once it mixes with other money in a wallet.
 *
 * This is the question every serious tracing argument turns on, and there is no
 * single right answer — only rules, each with a cost. A wallet holding 9,000
 * USDT receives 1,000 of the victim's, then sends 1,000 onward:
 *
 *   haircut  The wallet is 10% tainted, so everything leaving is 10% tainted:
 *            100 USDT of the victim's money left. Conservative, never
 *            over-claims, and *dilutes* — a launderer defeats it by routing
 *            through high-volume wallets until the share rounds to nothing.
 *
 *   fifo     First in, first out. The clean 9,000 arrived first, so it leaves
 *            first: none of the victim's money has left yet. Harder to dilute
 *            on purpose, and it is the rule English courts have reached for on
 *            mixed funds since Clayton's Case (1816).
 *
 * Both are defensible and they disagree, sometimes by an order of magnitude.
 * Running the trace under each brackets the answer instead of asserting one,
 * which is the honest thing to put in front of an officer — and it is the
 * answer to the sharpest question this method faces: what happens when the
 * criminal mixes stolen funds with clean ones.
 *
 * Not implemented: poison (every wallet that touches the money is wholly
 * tainted) taints bystanders within a couple of hops, and LIFO is FIFO's mirror
 * with no legal tradition behind it. Neither would tell an investigator
