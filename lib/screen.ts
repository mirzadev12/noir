/**
 * Sanctions screening for an address on any chain OFAC lists.
 *
 * The tracer follows USDT on TRON and nothing else. Screening is the part of
 * "support multiple blockchain ecosystems" that can be done honestly today on
 * every chain at once: an exact match against the OFAC SDN list's digital-
 * currency addresses, with no chain read and no heuristic. It answers the
 * question an officer holding a non-TRON address asks first — is this a
 * designated party — and it is the same answer on any day the file is the same.
 *
 * One rule governs the wording: **listed is a finding, not listed is not a
 * clearance.** OFAC lists a small fraction of the addresses any designated
 * party controls, so "not on the list" says nothing about the address; the
 * route and the screen both say so rather than letting silence read as clean.
 *
 * TRON addresses are answered from `lib/labels.ts`, the one table the tracer
 * reads, so a TRON address can never screen differently from how a trace
 * labels it.
