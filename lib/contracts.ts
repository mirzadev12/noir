 * Where USDT on Ethereum stops being traceable as USDT.

 * Money that enters a DEX pool is swapped or pooled with everyone else's; money
 * that enters a bridge leaves Ethereum. Following such a contract's outflows
 * would follow other people's money — a pool pays out to unrelated swappers —
 * and could name one of them as the exit. So the trace stops at a contract and
 * says what it is, from the explorer's own tags, or says it could not tell.
 *
 * Smart-contract *wallets* are the exception: a Safe multisig or an EIP-7702
 * account holds its owner's money like any wallet, and is followed as one.
