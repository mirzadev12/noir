/**
 * The four sentences an officer pastes into a case file.
 *
 * AGENTS.md §11 offers this as an optional feature and suggests sending the
 * finished trace to a hosted language model for prose. This does not do that,
 * and the reason is the same one §11 itself raises: the defensive answer to
 * "what if the model hallucinates the exchange name" is *"it can't — attribution
 * is a deterministic lookup"*. That answer is stronger when it covers the whole
 * product rather than everything except the paragraph on the page.
 *
 * So the summary is assembled from the trace's own computed figures. Nothing
 * here decides anything: every number was already in the `TraceResult`, every
 * entity name comes through `entityPhrase`, and the same trace always produces
 * the same sentences. No key, no network call, no model, and nothing to cache
 * before a demo.
 *
 * It is also the honest thing to render under a heading that says "Summary" in
 * a document an officer signs — a generated paraphrase could drift from the
 * evidence printed six inches above it, and this cannot.
