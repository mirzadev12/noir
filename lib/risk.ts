/**
 * The six behavioural rules. AGENTS.md §9.
 *
 * Rules, not a model. Every flag has to be defensible line by line in front of a
 * court, which is why there is no scoring function here and nothing is learned
 * from data — each rule is a threshold someone chose, and the `reason` string
 * says what was observed and what it means.
 *
 * Those strings are rendered verbatim by the interface and read aloud by an
 * investigator. Write them as evidence, not as UI copy: state the number, then
 * state the inference, and never overstate the inference.
