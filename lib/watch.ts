/**
 * The watch on money that has not moved yet.
 *
 * A CRITICAL case is the most valuable thing on the desk and the most
 * perishable: the funds are sitting in a wallet with no outgoing transfers, and
 * the finding is true only until they move. The trace states it as at the
 * moment the chain was read — "funds at rest" is a claim with a timestamp, and
 * nobody was told when that timestamp stopped being true.
 *
 * So every CRITICAL case puts the wallet holding the funds on a watch, and the
 * desk re-asks the chain one narrow question about each: has it sent USDT since
 * the case was read? The answer is one of three, never two — moved, still at
 * rest, or **not checked** because the chain did not answer. A wallet we could
 * not read reported as still at rest is the same lie as reporting an unreadable
 * wallet as empty, and it would be told about the wallet an officer is most
 * likely to act on.
 *
 * Pure types and one pure function, so both the browser and the route use them.
