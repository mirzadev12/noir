/**
 * Who did it: the identity an action is recorded under.
 *
 * NOIR holds no passwords and never will. There are two sources of an
 * identity, and the record always says which one it came from:
 *
 *  - **Verified.** A deployment behind the department's sign-in gateway sets
 *    `NOIR_IDENTITY_HEADER` to the header that gateway adds (for example
 *    `x-forwarded-email`). The gateway has already authenticated the officer;
 *    NOIR takes the name from it, and takes nothing a browser says instead.
 *    Set it only when every request reaches NOIR through that gateway, or
 *    anyone could send the header themselves.
 *  - **Stated.** Without a gateway, the Officer ID and unit typed at sign-in
 *    are sent with each request, and recorded as stated, not verified.
 *
 * Header values are URI-encoded by the browser, because an HTTP header cannot
 * carry a unit named in Devanagari.
