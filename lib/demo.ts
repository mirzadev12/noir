/**
 * The safety net. AGENTS.md §10.
 *
 * The public chain endpoint rate-limits, venue wifi drops, and a live trace
 * takes half a minute on a good day. Teams lose finals to that. So three real
 * addresses were run through the live pipeline, and their complete results —
 * including the SHA-256 of every API response they were built from — are frozen
 * into `data/demo-cases.json`.
 *
 * This is not staged data. Every figure in a frozen case was computed by
 * `lib/tracer.ts` from real transfers read from the chain on the date recorded
 * in the file. What demo mode removes is the network, not the evidence.
 *
 * Three rules govern it, and all come from CONTEXT.md §3:
 *
 *  1. **A frozen trace is never served for an address it does not belong to.**
 *     The lookup is by exact address. If demo mode is on and the address is not
 *     in the file, the request goes to the chain like any other — and if the
 *     network is gone, it fails honestly. The moment a demo answers for an
 *     address it does not hold, nothing else on screen can be trusted.
 *  2. **A frozen trace never claims to be live.** The route stamps
 *     `x-noir-provenance: recorded` on it, `lib/api.ts` reads that header, and
 *     the screen shows RECORDED TRACE rather than LIVE TRACE.
 *  3. **A frozen trace answers only for the run it is.** See `answersFor`.
 *
 * The file is imported statically rather than read at runtime, so demo mode
 * needs no filesystem and no network — but it does mean a rebuild after
 * regenerating it.

 * window, it would print its own figures under someone else's parameters —
 * the same class of lie as answering for an address it does not belong to. A
 * blank amount or date means "the recorded run", which is what a bare link to
 * a recorded case has always meant. A request for another taint model is by
 * definition a question the file cannot answer, and goes to the chain; so does
 * a request for the chain as of any moment other than the one the case was
 * read at. As of that exact moment it is the recorded run, which is what a
 * link made from a recorded case carries.
 *
 * Both trace routes use this, so the rule cannot hold on one and not the other
 * — which is exactly how it stood before: the permalink checked, and the form
 * and batch triage did not.
