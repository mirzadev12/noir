/**
 * Where a wallet came from.
 *
 * Everything else in this tool looks forward: the money left the victim, where
 * did it go. That answers "where is it now" and leaves the other half of an
 * investigator's question untouched — *what is this address, and who put money
 * into it*. A wallet that first appeared six days before the fraud and was
 * funded by four unrelated payers is a different object from one that has been
 * settling merchant traffic for three years, and the trace graph shows neither.
 *
 * So this profiles a single wallet from its own transfer history: when it was
 * first and last seen, what came in and what went out, and the counterparties
 * on both sides ranked by value, each one run through the same attribution
 * table the tracer uses.
 *
 * Two honesty rules carry over from the rest of the pipeline and matter more
 * here, because this page invites conclusions about a wallet's age:
 *
 *  - An unreadable wallet is never an empty one. If the chain could not be
 *    read, the profile says so and states nothing else.
 *  - `firstSeen` is the oldest transfer *we read*. On a wallet whose history
 *    ran past the page limit that is not the day it opened, and the profile
 *    marks itself partial rather than letting a reader date the wallet from it.
