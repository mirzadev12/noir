/**
 * The audit log — the rules, kept free of files so tampering is tested on its
 * own (`tests/audit.test.mjs`).
 *
 * One entry for every trace the server answers, every case saved to or taken
 * out of the shared case file, and every browser that turns alerts on or off,
 * in the order they happened. Each entry carries the SHA-256 of the one before
 * it, so the log is a chain.
 *
 * What the chain proves: these are the entries as written, in the order
 * written. Changing, removing or reordering any one of them breaks the chain
 * at that entry, and `verifyChain` names it. What it cannot prove on its own:
 * that the whole file was not swapped for a different chain that is consistent
 * with itself, or that the server's clock was right. The first is answered by
 * writing the head hash down somewhere the server cannot reach — a case diary,
 * a covering letter — because every later log must still pass through it; the
 * page prints the head for exactly that. Who did something is recorded with how
 * far it can be trusted (`lib/identity.ts`).
