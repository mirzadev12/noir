/**
 * Alerts when the desk is closed — the rules, kept free of files and network
 * so each decision is tested on its own (`tests/alerts.test.mjs`).
 *
 * The desk's watch (`lib/watch.ts`) asks the chain only while a desk is open,
 * and a CRITICAL wallet that empties at 3 a.m. is then found at 9. With alerts
 * on, the officer's browser hands the same list to the server, the server asks
 * the same one question — has it sent USDT since the case was read? — every
 * five minutes whether or not any desk is open, and wakes the browser with a
 * notification when the answer changes.
 *
 * What does not change is the three answers. A wallet the chain did not answer
 * for is asked again next time; it is never reported as still at rest, and it
 * never produces an alert. And each wallet is reported to each browser once:
 * the notification says that it moved and sends the officer to the desk, where
 * the desk's own check shows where the money went.
