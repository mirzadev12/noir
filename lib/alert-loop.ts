/**
 * The server's own check: every five minutes, whether or not any desk is open.
 *
 * Started once per server process — from `instrumentation.ts` when the server
 * starts, so a server that has just been deployed or woken resumes on its own,
 * and from the alerts route as well, in case it was not. Each round asks the
 * chain about every wallet some browser is still waiting to hear about, one
 * request each, through the same clients and the same shared pacing a trace
 * uses, so the check can never crowd out an officer's trace. It never runs two
 * rounds at once, and a round with nothing to ask reads nothing.
 *
 * A round asked for while one is running is not dropped: it runs as soon as the
 * current one finishes, so a wallet added mid-round is not left for the next
 * scheduled one.
 *
 * Server-only.
