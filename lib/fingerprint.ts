/**
 * A case's findings fingerprint: one SHA-256 over what the case found.
 *
 * The evidence packet already lists the SHA-256 of every chain response it was
 * built from, but those digests cannot be checked later: a response body
 * carries the moment it was served (and, on Ethereum, a price), so the same
 * query answers with different bytes tomorrow. What *can* be checked later is
 * the finding itself — confirmed transfers never change, and a pinned run
 * (`asof`) re-derives the same case on any later day. So the packet carries
 * the digest of the finding, and anyone holding a copy can have NOIR
 * re-derive the case from the public chain and compare.
 *
 * Covered: the run (chain, reported address, amount, window, the moment read),
 * the disposition, the exit, every wallet with its attribution (entity, kind,
 * source, confidence) and the victim money that reached it, every transfer
 * (hash, from, to, amount, time, time held) and every rule that fired, and
 * where. Not covered: the sentences. Prose is derived from these facts, and a
 * later NOIR that words a finding better must not make an older packet fail
 * its check; the figures a sentence states are all covered.
 *
 * Synchronous — the same SHA-256 the address checks use — so a document can
 * print its fingerprint during render.
