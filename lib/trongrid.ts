/**
 * The only place this project talks to the chain.
 *
 * Requirements come from AGENTS.md §8, and each one exists for a reason:
 *
 *  - An in-memory cache keyed by address. A BFS hits the same wallet many
 *    times; without this we get rate-limited during the demo.
 *  - Every response body is SHA-256 hashed. That is the chain of custody the
 *    evidence packet prints, and it costs three lines.
 *  - Every call is counted into `provenance.apiCalls`.
 *  - A 429 or a non-JSON body must never crash a trace. We back off, then give
 *    up on that page and return what we have.
 *
 * Response shape was verified against a live call, not taken from the doc:
 *   data: [{ transaction_id, block_timestamp, from, to, value, token_info }]
 *   meta: { fingerprint, page_size, links: { next } }
 *
 * `value` is a decimal string in base units. USDT on TRON has 6 decimals —
 * confirmed from `token_info.decimals` on a live response — so divide by 1e6.
 * Getting this wrong makes every figure in the demo absurd.
